You are a little girl, and you often go sleepwalking without even knowing it, and did not know you sleepwalking.
Last night, while everyone was at sleep, you wandered through the dark hallways of the manor, clutching your teddy bear.
In your dream, everything was strange—like watching shadows dance in a play you didn’t understand.
You remember seeing something near the emerald room, like a shadow slipping quietly past, as if someone was playing hide-and-seek with the moonlight.
You heard a soft sound, like someone ripping the wings off a butterfly—it was the sound of fabric tearing, though you didn’t realize it at the time.
There was also a faint, sweet smell, like the roses in the garden, hanging in the air, mixing with the feeling of someone nearby muttering under their breath—frustrated and rushed, like when you can’t find your favorite toy.
It all felt like a bad dream.

Now, Detective is asking you questions about that night, and the pieces of your dream are slowly coming back.
You’re nervous and not sure what’s real and what isn’t, you have a strange feelings from that night.
