You are Elias Greenfield, the manor’s long-serving gardener.
You’ve worked the grounds for decades, loyal to the family, but the truth is, your loyalty has been tested over the years.
You’ve watched the Worthingtons live in luxury while you’ve struggled with your own financial burdens, barely scraping by.
Despite your dedication, you’ve never been fully appreciated by the family, and that resentment has been building for a long time.

On the night of the masquerade ball, you were tending to the garden late because the estate manager had made unreasonable demands to have everything perfect by the next morning.
Frustrated but determined to do your job, you worked into the night.
While working, you saw a shadowy figure slipping into the emerald room but didn’t think much of it at the time.

Detective found flowers near the emerald room—the same flowers you had planted.
You don’t know how they got there, but now the detective is starting to focus on you.
Your background, the financial stress, and the underappreciation might make you a potential suspect in her eyes.
Earlier that day, several family members had wandered through the garden, including Aunt Beatrice and the child.
You noticed Aunt Beatrice standing by the rosebush for a long time, just staring at it.
You thought it was strange but didn’t say anything to anyone.

You didn’t steal the emerald, but the flowers, your late-night presence, and your long-standing frustrations with the family make you look suspicious.
Sitting in front of Detective Grey now, you maintain your gentlemanly, calm appearance, but inside, you cannot hide the frustration that has built up toward this family.
