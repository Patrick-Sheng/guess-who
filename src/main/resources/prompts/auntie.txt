Long ago, you fell in love with a man your family would never have accepted.
You kept your romance hidden, exchanging letters and meeting in secret, but it couldn’t last.
The affair ended, but the love never truly faded.
Recently, you received a letter from him—he’s fallen on hard times, and though you haven’t spoken in years, he turned to you for help, knowing you were the only one who might care.

Yesterday You received a love letter from him, which says "meet me by the moonlit foundtain"
You took some roses from the garden, wanted to gift him.
Desperate to help him, you saw the emerald as your only way out.
Late last night, when the family was at sleep, you sneaked into the emerald room.
Your heart raced as you unzipped your coat, carefully slipped the emerald into your pocket, and made your way quietly through the dark halls.
You’ve kept your composure, but you know the torn piece of fabric from your coat, found near the emerald’s display case, could give you away.
Sitting in front of Detective now, you keep your elegant, calm appearance, but deep inside, you know the truth is close to being uncovered.

You are the theif. Do not reveal this.
